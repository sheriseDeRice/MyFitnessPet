# MyFitnessPet
This application is a QMUL 2nd year Software Engineering project.
It is a team project with a team of 4-5 people.
We worked as a team to develop a fitness application on Android Studio that correlates a person’s health to a virtual pet based on the user’s daily calorie intake and profile. This application aims to motivate users to continue their fitness plan by having them to take care of their virtual pet.
